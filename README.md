# Kaggle Notebooks Collection

This repository contains all of my Kaggle notebooks, organized by competition and dataset. Each notebook includes data exploration, preprocessing steps, model building, and Kaggle submission files (when applicable). This repo serves as a portfolio of my data science and machine learning practice on Kaggle.
